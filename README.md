## Nature of code 3D
### Chapter 6. Autonomous Agents

Daniel Shiffman's [Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com/) examples in 3D, ported to javascript (ES6) using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).

I did this mostly to learn something more about 3D programming and Three.js, while enjoying the beautiful work of Daniel Shiffman again (I had already read his book based on Processing).
All this is reeeeeeally basic and could be greatly improved. Comments and pull requests are very welcome: please open an issue.

**TODO:** Create a GPGPU version of some examples, using the GPU to calculate motion.
